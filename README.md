# Militia PvP Bot for EVE Online

## Description

This project aims to develop a bot for EVE Online tailored for militia PvP gameplay. The final product will include profiles for both Fleet Member and Flight Commander roles and will be capable of offensive and defensive plexing. While a downsized version of this bot can be utilized for income generation within EVE, the primary focus lies in creating a bot proficient in militia PvP environments. This entails the ability to discern which ships to engage and which to avoid, as well as cooperation with other bots against human players.

The key libraries utilized in this project are:

- **PyAutoGUI:** For image detection and automated interaction with EVE Online's graphical interface.
- **EasyOCR:** For text recognition.
